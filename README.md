This was the second code I ever wrote. The idea for the program i got from watching the MIT open course material on learning coding through pythoing, the professor casually mentioned writing a program to find prime numbers was fun so i decided to do it myself.

As an added challange I had the program ask the user for 2 numbers, and it would find all prime numbers between them. Despite having the program running in a day, i continued to work on this for the next 3 days constantly realizing ways i could optimaize it to make it run faster thus being able to handle larger ranges.

It was after writing this code that I knew I wanted to switch careers.
